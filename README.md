Vowel counter
This was a final question on the Cisco python course that I chose to answer.
The idea was based around the poem Jabberwockey, by Lewis Carol.
To complete the assignment, I had to write a python programme that woul count the vowels in the poem.
I decded to do this by iterating through the text with for loops and counting the instances of vowels.
