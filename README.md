# Vowel Counter

This Python program counts the number of vowels in a given text. It was developed as a solution for the final question in the Cisco Python course.

## Features

- Iterates through the input text using `for` loops to count the occurrences of vowels.
- Supports counting both uppercase and lowercase vowels.
- Provides a simple and efficient method for vowel counting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vowel-counter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd vowel-counter
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python vowel_counter.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Input the text you want to count the vowels for when prompted.
2. Press Enter to start the vowel counting process.
3. The program will display the total count of vowels in the given text.

## Example

Suppose you want to count the vowels in the following text:

```
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
```

When you run the program and provide the above text as input, the output will be:

```
Total vowels: 58
```
